NOTE THAT THIS IS PRE_RELEASE 
 the idea of this repository is to include Linear algebra essentials for cpp
 this project also considered a object orriantation practice please shoot me a feedback if there is any concerns :)

Features
Matrix Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition.
Vector Operations: Dot product, cross product, and normalization.
Linear Systems: Solve equations using methods like Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion.
Performance: Designed for efficient computations using C++.
Scalability: Handles large datasets with ease.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To use this library, you'll need:
